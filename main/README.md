*** The Earthquake detector project group ***
We have developed a home earthquake detection device that can warn surrounding users, to help them promptly evacuate from dangerous areas. In addition, the device is also connected to the internet so that information can be continuously updated on the website we developed from which users can monitor the device's operations remotely. We also use the earthquake data API to both display earthquakes around the world and so that if an earthquake occurs, experts and researchers can also receive information about the earthquake. land to promptly have a solution plan.

We use Raspberry Pi 4 to operate and process data from sensors. We use the MPU 6050 sensor to be able to collect vibrations when an earthquake occurs and the bruzzer device to issue warnings to people around.
