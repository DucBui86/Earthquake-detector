EARTHQUAKE DETECTOR

Earthquakes pose a significant threat to human life and infrastructure, emphasizing the critical need for efficient detection systems to mitigate their impact. This project aims to design and develop an advanced earthquake detector capable of swift and accurate seismic activity detection. Leveraging sensor technologies and data analysis algorithms, this detector intends to provide timely warnings, enabling proactive measures to minimize casualties and damage. Through collaborative efforts in engineering, geophysics, and data science, this project strives to contribute to the creation of robust early warning systems, fostering resilience in earthquake-prone regions globally.

The sensor array collects real-time seismic data, which is processed and transmitted to a dedicated website interface. This user-friendly platform displays the gathered information in an accessible format, including live updates on seismic activity, magnitude estimations, and location data. By making this information readily available and comprehensible to the public, it empowers individuals, emergency services, and authorities to make informed decisions during seismic events, fostering a more prepared and responsive community.
